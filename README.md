## Hi, I’m Jordan

I’m a data coordinator and business analytics graduate student with hands-on experience in data coordination, analytics, and cybersecurity-focused projects. My work sits at the intersection of data analysis, operations, and secure information handling, with a strong interest in remote and globally distributed teams.

I’ve worked and lived across U.S. and APAC time zones, coordinated data and schedules for multiple stakeholders, and completed real-world academic projects involving cybersecurity audits, risk assessment, and applied analytics. I enjoy turning messy data into clear insights and building practical solutions that support decision-making.

Currently, I’m focused on strengthening my analytics portfolio, deepening my technical skills, and exploring remote or internationally oriented roles where data, business strategy, and technology overlap.

**Interests**
- Data analysis and visualization
- Business and operations analytics
- Cybersecurity fundamentals and risk assessment
- Remote-first and global work environments

**Tools**
Python, R, SQL, Git, GitHub, Excel, data visualization libraries
